# FrontEnd_ToDO_List



# To-Do List Application

This is a simple and fully functional To-Do List application built as a part of a front-end assignment. The app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, and it stores all tasks locally using the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persists across sessions without any backend or database setup.

The project is built using React and Redux Toolkit for state management, and it includes toast notifications to provide feedback on task operations.
